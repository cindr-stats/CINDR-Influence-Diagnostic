## Overview

**CINDR** (Calibrated Influential Nonlinear Dimension Reduction) is an R package designed to provide diagnostic tools for detecting influential observations in nonlinear dimension reduction models. It enables robust and calibrated tools to detect influential observations that impact the efficacy of multivariate mapping methods.

## Features

- **Influence Diagnostics** for multivariate mapping methods, such as Classical MDS, Sammon Mapping, and isoMDS.
- **Calibration Techniques** to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
- **Simulation Study Code** overviewed in the related manuscript.


## Installation
